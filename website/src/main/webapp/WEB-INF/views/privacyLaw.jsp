	<h3>Privacy Laws</h3>
	<p>"With more and more data being collected by various
		Organizations to make the day-to-day life easier, risks to privacy has
		increased many fold. Thus, lifestyle and ease at the cost of Privacy
		has become a big question and concern.</p>
	<p>There are situations when individuals, groups and organizations
		do misuse the collected data for direct or indirect monetary benefits
		leading to breach of Privacy of others. In last two decades, events of
		such breaches have increased significantly which has forced
		Governments across geographies to define Data Privacy & Protection
		laws. These laws focus primarily on collection, processing and
		protection of data of their citizens within and outside the perimeters
		of the country. At times these laws also take care of non citizens
		data collected from other geographies for business purposes.</p>
	<p>There are about 80 countries in the world which have some kind
		of Data Privacy & Protection law. Following countries have the most
		comprehensive data protection law with penal provisions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Europe (General Data Protection Regulation)</li>
		<li>UK (Separate Data Protection Act likely after Brexit)</li>
		<li>Canada</li>
		<li>US</li>
		<li>Australia</li>
		<li>Russia</li>
		<li>Singapore</li>
