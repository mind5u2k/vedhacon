	<h3>Implement</h3>
	<p>Implementation is the most difficult part in a privacy program
		as it relates to culture. It starts right from training, followed by
		gap analysis and then implementation customized to the needs of an
		Organization. Our team with vast experience in the implementation of
		Privacy across different business verticals and geographies can assist
		Organizations in planned and effective implementation.</p>
	<p>We at Vedhacon believe in ""One suit doesn't fit all"" and thus
		designs customized implementation plan for each organization. The team
		hand holds and provides oversight/governance during implementation to
		make it glitch free, timely and effective. Our flagship Assessment
		tool, ARM, helps in performing gap analysis/assessments, reporting and
		tracking centrally.</p>
