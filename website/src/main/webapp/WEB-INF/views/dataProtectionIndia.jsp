	<h3>Data Protection Framework for India</h3>
	<p>"Evolution of privacy in India has taken a long way since 1950s
		to be finally considered as Fundamental Right through a landmark
		judgement in August 2017.</p>
	<p>Indian judiciary and the Supreme Court in particular, have dealt
		with the issue of privacy, both as a fundamental right under the
		constitution and as a common law right. The common thread through all
		these judgments by the supreme court of India has been to recognize
		right to privacy either as a fundamental under the constitution or as
		a common law right, but to refrain from giving a specific definition
		before the recent landmark judgement.</p>
